# TCP & UDP

This repository only for personal learning on how to create TCP and UDP client-server.

# TCP
This folder containing example of creating tcp client and server.

For running the tcp server:
```
go run ./tcp/server.go port
```

For running the tcp client you can open a new terminal and run the code with this command:
```
go run ./tcp/client.go host:port
```

Once client and server is running you can start typing on the client session.
Example:
```
client: hello
server: 2020-06-29T18:00:35+07:00
```

To stop the apps, just type `STOP`.
